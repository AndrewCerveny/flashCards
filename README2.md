# FlashCards


### Abstract: 
The objectives of this project are; to practice TDD testing,learning mocha and chai relationship, to practice expect syntax,to see how an array iterator can be used in a project, and to practice class to class interaction.

### Wins:
I figured out how to use an iterator method to create my new card instances. I also had two more successes with one trying to find a way to test my game class. and the other was trying to figure out how endGame was invoked which was in the util file. 

### Challenges:
The first challenge I had regarding TDD testing was trying to create a test file before creating the class. When the class became more complex it was much harder to seperate out testing my file before creating my class.  This messed up my branch naming as i started making the class and the test together. 

The second challenge I had with the project was figuring out how to test for game.start. I ended up not having a test for game start but i made test to check that i was creating new instance in seperate methods.  

The third challenge I had was there was no message invoked at the end of the game telling the user the percentage of incorrect and correct guesses. I asked for help and someone suggested console.logging the message so that it would appear in the terminal and that seemed to fix the issue. 

### Future Features:
Additions that I could potentially do are create conditions that if a person were to get a certain percent wrong a console.log message appears to try playing the card again. The second addition could be to create another deck of cards that could be played and ran through the game.
